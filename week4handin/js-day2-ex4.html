<select id="car-selector">
  <!-- Options will be populated by JavaScript -->
</select>
<body>
<h2>Selected Brand</h2>
<h4 id="car-make"></h4>

<div>
  <a href="index.html">Go back to start</a>
</div>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 5px; padding: 1em">

  The select element is great for when you have a predetermined list of options
  the user should have access too. <br />
  To solve this exercise, I made a function that iterates the array of cars and
  create a new entry into the select element for every car and how it's value and how it's presented in the dropdown list, which in this page is the same. <br />
  appendChil is used to insert an element into another element, like here we insert a car element to the options element.
</div>

<script>
  const cars = ["Ford", "WW", "Toyota", "Volvo"]; //Assume this was fetched from the backend
  //TODO
  // The select element get populated with the car-makers
  const selectCar = document.getElementById("car-selector");

  cars.forEach((c) => {
    const option = document.createElement("option");
    option.value = c;
    option.text = c;
    selectCar.appendChild(option);
  });

  //when a value is selected, read the selected value and update the element with id= car-make with the value as sketched below

  selectCar.addEventListener("change", (event) => {
    document.getElementById("car-make").innerText = event.target.value;
  });
</script>
